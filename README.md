===========================================================

How to install:
===============
1. Download and install "Melon Loader" by HerpDerpinstine
https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/
This creates a new folder named "Mods" in your TLD folder.

2. Extract everything from the ZIP file to your new TLD\Mods folder (overwrite old files)

3. In addition you need to install:
- ModSettings

You can find everything on: https://xpazeman.com/tld-mod-list/

5. Start the game!

===========================

What does it do?
=================

Picks up sticks and stones in a radius around you.

You can configure the size of the radius, 
the calorie penalty for picking up items,
and choose if only sticks / stones or both get picked up.

In addition you can put a "StickPickCustomList.txt" file in your Mods folder,
to add custom items that get picked up. One item per line, no spaces!

eg.
GEAR_Arrow
GEAR_ArrowHead
GEAR_ArrowShaft

Use the following list:
https://the-long-dark-modding.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Name

Note: 
Not all items from that list are getting picked up. Only items that are actually on the "GEAR" object layer (17).
Please report any items that don't work.

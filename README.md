The Long Dark - QuickPick Version 2.1.0 by Primadonna and Digitalzombie
===========================================================

How to install:
===============
1. Download and install "Melon Loader" by HerpDerpinstine
https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/
This creates a new folder named "Mods" in your TLD folder.

2. Extract everything from the ZIP file to your new TLD\Mods folder (overwrite old files)

3. In addition you need to install:
- ModSettings

You can find everything on: https://xpazeman.com/tld-mod-list/

5. Start the game! 

===========================

What does it do?
=================

Allows for picking up more items quicker. You can skip the inspect menu to pick items up with one click, and pick up items in an AoE.

In addition you can put a "QuickPickCustomList.txt" file in your Mods folder,
to add custom items that get picked up. One item per line, no spaces!

eg.
GEAR_Arrow
GEAR_ArrowHead
GEAR_ArrowShaft

Use the following list:
https://the-long-dark-modding.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Name

Note: 
Not all items from that list are getting picked up. Only items that are actually on the "GEAR" object layer (17).
Please report any items that don't work.

PLEASE REPORT ALL BUGS TO PRIMADONNA ON THE MODDING DISCORD
